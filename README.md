# Tic-Tac-Toe

This application allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

## To Play for Yourself:
***
Please visit the following link: https://brittgithub.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-client/

**Please note**: In order to play, you must first create an account. Once you have created an account, you can simply sign in to play moving forward!

**How to Play**: Once you are signed in with your account, you can click "New Game" and then a new Tic-Tac-Toe board will appear. 

To begin playing, select any square on the board. The first player will always be player `X` and the second player will always be player `O`. The player who gets three Xs or Os in a row on the board (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) will win. If neither player `X` or player `O` get 3 in a row before all spaces are occupied, there will be a tie. 

To start a new game, click "New Game" and the board will reset to a blank game board.
